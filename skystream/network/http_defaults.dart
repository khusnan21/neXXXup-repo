/// many CDNs / origin servers tie the signed playback URL to that UA (or
/// simply 403 any non-browser UA). If the *player* then fetches the stream
/// with libmpv's built-in `Lavf/xx` UA — or the resolver fetches with Dio's
/// default `Dio/xx` — the origin sees a different, non-browser identity and
/// rejects playback even though resolution succeeded.
///
/// Worse, libmpv's default UA differs per platform build (Windows shinchiro
/// winbuild vs the bundled macOS/Android libs), so the same stream can play
/// on one desktop OS and 403 on another. Forcing one consistent, real
/// browser UA across resolve + playback removes that entire class of
/// cross-platform divergence.
